## Minimalistic Webpack Kit

`Vue, TypeScript, pug, scss, hot module replacement`

A simple Vue.js app which counts the number of clicks 
and changes the color of the button depending on that number.
The number can also be reset.

This kit was made from scratch for the sake of practicing the above mentioned technologies. I called it _"minimalistic"_ as it contains only which is really needed and in fact used (not the usual case if you take a ready ðŸš€ kit :).

The excercise was highly inspired by **Henry James'** [online tutorial on TypeScript](https://typescriptcourses.com/typescript-fundamentals).

[App at GitHub Pages](https://nata25.github.io/minimalistic/).
